## Create a web 3.0 app with React and Solidity smart contract
In this project, I created crytocurreny exchange platform that have the client side of the project and the smart contract aspect.
The Client side was built using the React frame work Vite.js to be specific while the smart contract was built using solidity

## The tools, framework and features used in this projects includes;
* Vite.js : This was use to create the react app for the project
* TailwindCSS : This was used for styling the project
* Solidity: This is the programming language used in creating and designing  the smart contract
* Hardhat: This was used in creating the smart_contract of the project
* Ropsten ethereum : This was used to generate a demo ethereum value
* Goerli faucet : This was equally used to generat a demo ethereum value as the Ropsten ethereum was being depr
* Metamask: This a cryptocurrency wallet that was used to create accounts used in the project, Metamask was used to receive and send ethereum from one account to another
* CSS messh: This was used to create the color gradient of the project background
* Giphy.com: Was used to generate the various GIFs that accompanied each transaction, to make it look less boring

## Highlights of the projects includes:
* Creating an interactive user friendly interface with react and tailwindcss
* Designing and creacting a smart contract using solidity programming language
* Connecting the react app with the create smart contract
* Connecting metamask to the project to enable the creation of accounts on the wallet
* Generating demo ethereum value from goerli faucet and ropsten ethereum in other to ensure that transactions can be made with metamask
* Adding latest transaction to the project ensure that we are able to keep up with all transactions made
* Deploying the project to Github
* Deploying the project to Vercel for live demonstration

## Thank you for reading, I hope you do find some insight about the project!
